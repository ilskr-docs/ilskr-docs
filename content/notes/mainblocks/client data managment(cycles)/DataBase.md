To storage client info (client, farm, house, device, cycle, breed, gender, cycle_start_day, standard weights and statistics per each clinet-breed-gender) PostgreSQL is used. SQL database allows to stora data in strict format so all cycle-houses info is standartized and prepared for usage through code. As a backup all this info is also stored in xlsx files on local servers. Later this data is used in any scripts, processes and tasks - all python scripts access DB to get client info, all tasks specification goes through DB (if we want to get PC scores for CGTHBG Cycle 2 - we set this filter in script and script access DB to get all further info to choose proper pack of data).
