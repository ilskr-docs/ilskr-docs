There are metrics like "relative error on day N" and "stability"; the latter is considered as the average of the absolute differences of the predicates for the current day compared to the predicates for the previous one, each of them is attributed to an interval (usually there are 3 of them) and each interval has its own weight, just like each future day has its weight - usually, incrementally from 0.33 to 1 evenly; + the error on N day has more weight than stability, i.e. each "metric" is also assigned its own weight. Next, the weighted average is considered and then it's not the end yet, then next we look at the proportion (%) of the cycle-house-day lines in the error table that have an error below 0.0 N% (for example, 2 or 5); ideally, 0.98-1.0 should be below 0.05 + we look at errors on the day of mutual funds;
