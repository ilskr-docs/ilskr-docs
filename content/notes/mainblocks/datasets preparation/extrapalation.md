There're 2 different modes of extrapolation/interpolation:
- extrapolation of features - averages per day
- extrapolation of features - distribution per day (when we study at individual kappa, +-500 chickens/day)

Each feature has its own way of extrapolation/interpolation. Possible ways of extrapolation are: 
- use standard of this feature by day to enter standard curve into real means and fill missed values
- fill missed values by values from the nearest available days
