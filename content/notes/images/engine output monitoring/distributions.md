checks allows to see average day distribution for features (especially for volume, also for day_average_density and mass_core) (distributions checks). What usually checks here:

1. volume overfiltration by statistics (if exists need to regenerate statistics and recalibrate engine)
2. density overcorrection (if outlier houses with too low volumes/too high volumes get much higher/much lower density in comparison with average density). Threshold is 5%. 
3. normality of distributions (abnormal cases: too long right/left tails, skewness, 2+ distribution vertex etc)

normal practice - take akk calibration data (or subset from calibration data and compare new cycle-houses with calibration data)
