(comparison with calibration data)  Comparing new data with calibration data using mahalanobis_report_simple.py (takes mahalanobis_report_config_simple.yaml fith choosen filters as input, and choosen fetures combinations)
Allows to notice an anomalies with new data such volume/mass inversion and  geometry deviations. 

Input: PC results by particular engine folder, specialized filters (what exact client, farms, houses, cycles we want to check). 

What should be checked to understand that cycle is normal:
-   [Volume, mass curve (how smooth and logic it is)](https://www.notion.so/FIELD-WORK-check-list-53d8ddaf9f5349979f7759cac3afc3c9)
-   [Order of houses by volume should be same as by mass](https://www.notion.so/FIELD-WORK-check-list-53d8ddaf9f5349979f7759cac3afc3c9)
-   [Estimated image quality (tilt, missing values)](https://www.notion.so/FIELD-WORK-check-list-53d8ddaf9f5349979f7759cac3afc3c9)
-   [Difference between devices in one house](https://www.notion.so/FIELD-WORK-check-list-53d8ddaf9f5349979f7759cac3afc3c9)
-   [Distributions (to check over filtration and overcorrection by models, compare with previous cycles – to understand if we’ve ever seen like that before)](https://www.notion.so/FIELD-WORK-check-list-53d8ddaf9f5349979f7759cac3afc3c9)
